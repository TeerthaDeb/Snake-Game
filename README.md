# Snake Game

This is a console-based Snake Game written in C++. The game allows players to control a snake, eat food, and grow longer while avoiding collisions with the snake's own body and walls.

## Features

- Control the snake using `w`, `a`, `s`, `d` keys (or arrow keys).
- Regular food increases score.
- Special food appears every time the score is a multiple of 10, giving additional points.
- Pause functionality (`p` key).
- Game over when the snake collides with itself or the walls.
- High score functionality with file persistence.
